    "text": "Basic first aid is when an individual provides emergency aid or treatment to someone that is\ninjured or suddenly ill prior to the arrival of medical services. (1) Once the individual is assessed\nby a trained medical professional, it may be determined that transport services may be\nindicated to move the individual to a higher level of care.\nAny vehicle used as an ambulance must be designed and equipped to respond to medical\nemergencies and, in nonemergency situations, be capable of transporting beneficiaries with\nacute medical conditions. These services may involve ground or air transport in both emergency\nand non-emergency situations. The means of transport must be staffed by individuals who are\nqualified in accordance with State and local laws where the services are being rendered. These\nlaws may vary from State to State or within a State. (2)\nLevels of transport include (2):\n\u2022 Basic Life Support (BLS);\n\u2022 Advanced Life Support, Level 1 (ALS1);\n\u2022 Advanced Life Support, level 2 (ALS2);\n\u2022 Specialty Care Transport (SCT).\nAdvanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS)\nA constellation of clinical interventions for the urgent treatment of cardiac arrest, stroke and\nother life-threatening medical (non-traumatic) emergencies in which basic life support efforts\nof cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are augmented. ACLS may include airway management,\nvein assessment, interpretation of electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG), application of emergency\npharmacology and early defibrillation with automated external defibrillators (AED) as needed.\n(3)\nAdvanced Life Support, level 1 (ALS1)\nWhen medically necessary, includes the transportation by a ground ambulance vehicle and the\nprovision of medically necessary supplies and services including the provision of an ALS\nassessment or at least one ALS intervention. (2)\nAdvanced Life Support, level 2 (ALS2)\nAdvanced Life Support, level 2 (ALS2) includes the transportation by a ground ambulance\nvehicle and the provision of medically necessary supplies and services including at least 3\nseparate administrations of 1 or more medications by intravenous push/bolus or by continuous\ninfusion (excluding crystalloid fluids) OR at least 1 of the ALS2 procedures listed below (2):\n\u2022 Defibrillation/cardioversion;\n\u2022 Endotracheal intubation;\nAmbulance and Transport Services/ADM1001.005\nPage 6\n\n\u2022 Central venous line;\n\u2022 Cardiac pacing;\n\u2022 Chest decompression;\n\u2022 Surgical airway; or\n\u2022 Intraosseous line.\nBasic Life Support (BLS)\nWhen medically necessary, the provision of BLS services is defined as transportation by a\nground ambulance vehicle and the provision of medically necessary supplies and services,\nincluding BLS ambulance services as defined per individual State. The ambulance must be\nstaffed by an individual who is qualified in accordance with State and local laws as an\nemergency medical technician-basic (EMT-Basic). (2) Each state has an individualized defined\nscope of practice; generally, the duties of the EMT-Basic are to quickly assess and triage\nrequests for medical care, provide stabilizing measures, provide necessary transport and\nrequest additional resources as needed. The EMT-Basic is often paired with higher levels of\npersonnel as part of an ambulance crew or other responding group. Additional tasks may\ninclude at a minimum, but are not limited to, the following interventions (2, 4):\n\u2022 Assessment and management of airway (e.g., oropharynx or nasopharynx);\n\u2022 Use of positive pressure ventilation devices (e.g., manually triggered ventilators, automatic\ntransport ventilators);\n\u2022 Over the counter pharmacological interventions;\n\u2022 Stabilization of fractures.\nBasic Life Support (BLS) - Emergency\nWhen medically necessary, the provision of BLS services, as specified above, in the context of\nan emergency response (defined below). Advanced Life Support, level 1 (ALS1): when medically\nnecessary, the provision of an assessment by an Advanced Life Support (ALS) provider or\nsupplier or the provision of one or more ALS interventions. An ALS provider/supplier is defined\nas a provider trained to the level of the EMT-Intermediate or Paramedic. An ALS intervention\nprovides procedures beyond the scope of an EMT-Basic as defined in the National EMS Scope of\npractice model.
